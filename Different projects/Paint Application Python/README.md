# Paint in Python

This project is a very basic paint application made in Python that have primary colors with different sizes of brush size and a feature to delete everything


# Possible Improvements 
This project can be upgraded by alot 

Points that come in mind for a simple Python :

- Increase the color palette by at least 10 more by having the sort of jsColors library but for Python <br>
- Add the feature to add a image on the canvas <br>
- Add a fill entire canvas <br>
- Change size of the canvas <br>
- Saving/loading canvas images so work isn't lost when closing the program. Basic file I/O functionality would make the app more polished. <br>
- Undo/redo feature similar to a ctrl Z hotkey
