# Paint in Python

This project is a very basic paint application made in Python that have primary colors with different sizes of brush size and a feature to delete everything

This Project has been moved to a new repository with all the features below done.

# Possible Improvements 
This project can be upgraded by alot 

Points that come in mind for a simple Paint Python :

- [x] Increase the color palette by at least 10 more by having the sort of jsColors library but for Python <br> 
- [x] Add the feature to add a image on the canvas <br> 
- [x] Add a fill entire canvas <br> 
- [x] Change size of the canvas <br> 
- Saving/loading canvas images so work isn't lost when closing the program. Basic file I/O functionality would make the app more polished. <br>
- [x] Undo/redo feature similar to a ctrl Z hotkey <br> 
- [x] Better aesthetic too.
